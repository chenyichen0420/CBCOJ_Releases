## Step 1: Download

Download binary files from Release v4.24.074. Please ensure that the executable file downloaded is for the corresponding platform.

Extract backend.zip to a folder, and frontend.zip to another.

## Step 2: Backend settings

Raw content structure of zip:

```
│  account.ini
│  basic_setting.ini
│  CBCOJ_Server.exe
│  log.txt
│  rc.txt
│
├─rec
├─work
├─work1
├─work2
└─pb
   │  setting.ini
   │
   └─aplusb
           setting.txt
           spj.cpp
           spj.exe
           test1.in
           test1.out
           test2.in
           test2.out
```

The `account.ini` follows the following setting format:

- The first line contains the count of accounts.
- Next, each line stores information for a single account.
- For each line, store the username, password, and user ID in sequence, separated by a space.

The `basic_setting.ini` follows the following setting format:

- The first line contains the number of judging threads.
- The second line contains the folder where stores source codes waiting for judging.
- The following lines contain the working folder for each judging threads.
- The next line contains the folder for the problem base.
- The next line contains the folder which stores all the judging results.
- The next line contains the path of g++ compiler.

`log.txt` is the log file generated by `CBCOJ_Server.exe`, and is safe to remove if `CBCOJ_Server.exe` isn't running.

`rc.txt` is a file which stores the submission id. Do not remove or change it directly!

`pb/setting.ini` stores the configuration of problems, with 'pb' stands for the folder you configured as problem base. `pb/setting.ini` follows the following setting format:

- The first line contains the number of problems.
- The following lines contain the name of each problem.

The configuration of each problem must be saved under a folder with the same name configured in `pb/setting.ini` in the folder 'pb'.

All test data should be put inside this folder. If special judge is needed, put the executable file required by SPJ in this directory as well. 'setting.txt' follows the following setting format:

- The first line contains the account of testcases, the file name required for file reading and writing (`*.in/out`), and the name of the executable file required by SPJ, separated with spaces.
- If you don't wan't SPJ, then fill `fc` in replace of it.
- The following lines contain the configuration of each testcases, including input/out file name (`*.in/out`), time limit (ms), and memory limit (MiB).

That's all of backend configurations.
